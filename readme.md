## 3D printer stuff

### Additional printer modifications

Control board is (Melzi 3.0 v3](https://reprap.org/wiki/Melzi#Melzi_Version_2.0)

####  Additional extruders

 [Adding a additional extruder](https://www.instructables.com/id/Adding-More-Extruders-to-Any-3d-Printer)
 
 - Need a additional power device/control board for hotbed.
 - Use hotbed power/temp sensor for additional extruder
 - Use XStop with LN298/stepper motor for second extruder
 - Diamond extruder can be installed with X,Y,Z stop and Arduino CNC board
 
#### Leveling

### Tests:

#### H0 railroad modeling

##### Extruder

Usage of 0.2mm extruder	is highly recomended. Probably, 0.3mm can be used too, but with 0.4mm is almost impossible to recieve suitable quality in size of H0.

##### Targets

	- rails
	- terrain vi heightmap
		
		
#### Gearbox and similar devices
