## 3D printer stuff

### Tests:

#### H0 railroad modeling

##### Extruder

Usage of 0.2mm extruder	is highly recomended. Probably, 0.3mm can be used too, but with 0.4mm is almost impossible to recieve suitable quality in size of H0.

##### Targets

	- rails
	- terrain vi heightmap
		
		
#### Gearbox and similar devices
